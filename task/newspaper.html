           Often called the ‘Warren Buffet of the Indian market’, Jhunjhunwala's net worth was estimated to be nearly $5.8 billion, according to Forbes. His demise came only a week after the launch of India's youngest budget airlines, Akasa Air. Jhunjhunwala was a co-founder and had 40 per cent stakes in the airline. He had appeared at the launch event in a wheelchair.
           Jhunjhunwala was one of the most influential market voices in India - Asia's third-biggest economy, with an intense following among the country's growing horde of retail investors. Jewellery retailer Titan Co. was one of the largest and most profitable investments for the veteran trader and his wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala, making up for over a third of their portfolio, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
